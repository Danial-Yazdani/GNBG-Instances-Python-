# GNBG-Instances-Python-
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Generalized Numerical Benchmark Generator (GNBG). The code is designed to work with a set of 24 pre-configured problem instances. The code operates independently of the GNBG generator file and only uses the saved configurations.
